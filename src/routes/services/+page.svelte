				Audits, Reviews, and Compilation

			<p>
				Prince CPA Firm, PLLC's financial statement services comprise all three levels of assurance
				depending on your company's needs.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm font-bold text-blue-950">Audits</p>
			<p>
				Audits offer the highest level of assurance to third parties, and include in-depth
				examination and confirmation of account balances, inventories, and selected transactions. We
				perform audits for you to remove errors, ascertaining the validity and reliability of your
				information.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm font-bold text-blue-950">Reviews</p>

				Reviews provide limited assurance to outside interests and involve inquiries and analytical
				procedures that confirm financial statement matters and identify any items requiring further
				analysis. We perform reviews to ensure the integrity of your data.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm font-bold text-blue-950">Compilations</p>
			<p>
				Compilations are usually requested for internal purposes and are based upon information
				provided by a company's management. They do not offer assurance but may involve some
				adjustment to accounting records.
